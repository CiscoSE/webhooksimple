A simple framework/CLI tool to setup and sync (Webex Teams) API webhooks


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://webhooksimple.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* Create, update and delete (Webex Teams) webhooks from a YAML file
* Modular architecture makes it suitable for other APIs as well

How to Use
----------

WebhookSimple is a simple (and open-source) python framework/command line tool that allows you to quickly describe your desired Webex Teams webhooks and then create or synchronise them for you.

WebhookSimple requires two files from you: *vars.yml* and *hooks.yml*

*vars.yml* specifies the different variables, while *hooks.yml* lets you specify the webhooks themselves.

A webhook always looks like this (in *hooks.yml*)

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   hooks:
     - name: test hook 1
       resource: "messages"
       event: "created"
       target_url: "https://your_url_here"

Make sure that the ``name`` of your webhook is always unique since this is what webhookSimple will use to identify and synchronise your webhooks.  Your ::vars.yml:: **must include**  an *adapter* that specifies the kind of API we are interacting with, as well as the authentication details. Leave this to the provided ``parser.WebexTeamsWebhookManager`` for now and add the access token in the correct spot.

*vars.yml*:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # vars file. The adapter section **needs** to be here
   adapter:
     name: WebexTeamsWebhookManager
     authentication:
       access_token: your access token here
     parameters:

   # Add your variables from here on
   urls:
     - https://www.cisco.com
     - https://www.google.com



You can now ``setup``\ , ``purge``\ , ``list``\ , ``export`` or ``sync``\  your webhooks.


* ``setup`` will **delete** all webhooks currently present for this bot and create new ones based on the *hooks.yml* file.
* ``sync`` will update all existing webhooks based on the ``name``\ attribute and create those not present. It will **not** delete webhooks that are registered on the server.
* ``purge``\ will delete all webhooks without creating new ones
* ``list``\ will list all webhooks currently registered
* ``export`` will save all your currently active webhooks to a .yml file

Invoke the module by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ls
   hooks.yml vars.yml
   $ python3 -m webhooksimple setup

Taking it one step further
--------------------------

Setting up a webhook from the command line, and based on a configuration file, is already pretty cool and convenient. But what if we have ten webhooks, and need to update the target_url on all of them? Weâ€™d have to manually edit all the webhook entries in ::hooks.yml::. This is where the ::vars.yml:: file comes into play. ::hooks.yml:: is not a simple configuration file but rather a `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/>`_ template of a configuration file. What you can do is this:

*vars.yml*

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   # Note: Adapter part (see above) omited for bravity
   url_prefix: https://my_url_base

*hooks.yml*:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   hooks:
     - name: test hook 1
       resource: "messages"
       event: "created"
       target_url: "https://{{ url_prefix }}/messages"

But this is not all. Those that worked with [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) before probably already know what is coming next. You can also add some (generator) logic here. Let's say we want to create two versions (_debug_ and _production_) of our webhook. We can do this by configuring the following:

*vars.yml*:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   # Note: Adapter part (see above) omited for brevity
   envs:
     - name: production
       url: https://my_production_prefix
     - name: development
       url: https://my_development_prefix

*hooks.yml*:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   hooks:
     {% for env in envs %}
     - name: {{ env.name }} message hook
       resource: "message"
       event: "created"
       target_url: {{ env.url }}/messages
     {% endfor %}

Or if you want to setup the same webhook for different URLs, it would look like this:

*vars.yml*:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   # Note: Adapter part (see above) omited for bravity
   urls:
    - https://url_number_1
    - https://url_number_2
    - https://url_number_3

*hooks.yml*:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   hooks:
     {% for url in urls %}
     - name: "hook for {{ url }}"
       resource: "message"
       event: "created"
       target_url: {{ url }}
     {% endfor %}

Happy programming! You can get WebhookSimple by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip3 install webhooksimple
